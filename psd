Problem Statement
Developers often struggle with managing their local projects, especially when it comes to pushing them to GitHub. This includes the overhead of using command-line Git, setting up repositories, handling commit messages, and organizing files — which becomes time-consuming and error-prone, particularly for beginners or non-technical contributors.

📝 Description
GitSync is a web-based platform that enables users to securely log in via GitHub, upload their local project as a zip, and manage these projects as inventories. With a single click, users can automatically push any project to their personal GitHub repository.

It simplifies the traditional Git workflow by removing the need for CLI knowledge, making version control and collaboration accessible to all levels of developers, students, and creators.

✅ Solution
GitSync bridges the gap between local development and GitHub by offering:

🔐 GitHub OAuth Login for secure access and repo management

📦 Inventory Uploads through zipped files, organized per user

🔄 One-Click Push to GitHub with auto repo creation, file commit, README & license setup

📊 Progress Tracking with real-time status updates during upload

🔍 User Discovery to explore other users’ public inventories and GitHub profiles

By removing the barriers to using Git, GitSync empowers users to share their work confidently, collaborate faster, and maintain a version-controlled workflow without ever touching a terminal.
